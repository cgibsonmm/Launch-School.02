1. is this design, with Human and Computer sub-classes, better? Why, or why not?
  - The design of the RPS game is improved because we eliminate unnecessary redundancies and logic that is no handled directly and more intelligently.

2. what is the primary improvement of this new design?
  - There is less use of conditionals in the player, computer, human classes,
  now the classes are aware of their state(human, computer)

3. what is the primary drawback of this new design?
  - The only draw back I can see is that we are still forced to repeat method definitions in different classes (example: set_name, choose), there may be a way to handle this with a mixin but it may not be worth the effort of rebuilding the necessary conditionals that were once deleted.
